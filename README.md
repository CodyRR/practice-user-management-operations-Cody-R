A lot of practice was trying to read the data from the table.  There is an entry where I add new columns and a few to populate them based on pre-existing data.  As discussed in the AI Zoom, I don't think deleting entries will be used a lot.  Someone mentioned having a column with isDeleted instead of deleting the data.
